# General Notes
```SELECT <column> FROM <table> WHERE <clause>``` does row-level operations, checks if each row satistifies the ```WHERE <clause>```.

Aggregate functions operate on multiple rows in the dataset.

```GROUP BY``` is used to apply aggregate functions on multiple subgroups of the dataset.

Nesting allows us to use the output of the inner query in an outer one.

```JOIN```s help us create augmented tables because the original table was missing the information we needed.

**It is very important to understand the order of execution.**
